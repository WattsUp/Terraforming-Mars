# Terraforming Mars Custom Box #
I made a custom box to hold the board game Terraforming Mars and 5 expansions: Venus Next, Colonies, Hellas & Elysium, Turmoil, and Prelude. I also 3D printed city tiles, greenery tiles, and every unique tile. Everything fits in a Pelican 1400 case (including the instruction manuals is right on the threshold of fitting easily).

## Construction Notes ##
- My printer was too small for a single print so I split each piece in two and used CA glue to recombine.
- The embossed text on the card tray is hard to read in black plastic, you could paint it
- Printing all custom freighters technically fits in the specified box but takes a while to Tetris it out. You could print fewer freighters or use the miscellaneous cubby.
- My Pelican 1400's bottom and top were warped from the injection molded plastic shrinking. Since its minimum dimensions still matched the provided CAD, I assume it is on all units. I printed two `Case_TreeTrayShim` and placed them on either side of the case's hump.
- To mitigate short tiles from shifting when the case is inverted, I cut the foam that came with the case to fit the tiles.
- Hand painting the printed tiles requires patience and/or friends. You could print with multiple filament colors as instructed in Srifraf's design.
- The original tiles do not have a reserved cubby. No need to include them unless you expect to have a very intensive ground game in excess of 16 generic cities and/or 32 greenery tiles. There is likely room in the city tray albeit unsecured.
